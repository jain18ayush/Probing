## Steps
- Want to mix and match data with probes 
- Train the probe on differing lengths of layers and find the best ones 
- Have data that is with combined and not combined 

-= Play with data
## Future Idea
- Create a probe tester : input a probe model and input a df and it allows you to see the effect of different probes and different data combinations
